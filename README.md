## Overview
A communication between 2 computers, connected by the media gateway, is to take place using the [someip](https://github.com/GENIVI/vsomeip) protocol.

## Task
Your task is to install the virtual machines on 2 computers (user: labc109, pw:C109) and start the communication via the existing network (MediaGateway).
The data exchange shall be logged with Wireshark and explained on the basis of the recor- ding.
In addition, the simulation of a node (server or client) can be done via ANDi.
